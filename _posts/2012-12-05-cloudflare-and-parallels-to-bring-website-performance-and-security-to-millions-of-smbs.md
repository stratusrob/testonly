<p>In early October we <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/?page=3&amp;_=1354574029699">quietly
announced</a> our
partnership with Parallels, a global leader in hosting, cloud services
enablement and desktop virtualization. Parallels makes it easier for
service providers, like webhosts, to grow their business with service
delivery software and a robust partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>Today, we are officially launching our partnership with Parallels. If
you are a Parallels Service Provider and are using either Plesk or
Parallels Automation, it means two things for you. First, your customers
will be able to activate CloudFlare with a few clicks from their
Parallels control panel. Second, you can now generate revenue by
offering CloudFlare Performance Plus in addition to CloudFlare Free.</p>
<p>The partnership has made it super easy for all Parallels Service
Providers to offer enterprise-grade performance and security to any
website, especially their SMB and e-commerce customers. To get started,
a hosting provider can install CloudFlare from the <a href="http://apsstandard.org/applications#searchterm=cloudflare">APS
catalog</a>.
Installation takes less than 5 minutes and CloudFlare can be activated
by all customers with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Since our soft launch, we worked with over a hundred Parallels Service
Providers who successfully integrated CloudFlare. In addition to
generating revenue, partners enjoy many operational benefits such as
reduced server load, bandwidth savings, protection from DDoS attacks and
an automatic IPv4/6 gateway. Here's what some of them are saying about
the partnership:</p>
<p>"As a result of our partnership with Parallels, we have been able to
bring a number of innovative solutions to our customers," said Celal
Ulgen, Chief Marketing Officer at SoftCom, parent company to the popular
myhosting.com. "Now that CloudFlare is available in Parallels
Automation, we will have another service to further improve our
customers' experience."</p>
<p>"CloudFlare is so much more than just a content delivery network; the
service optimizes web traffic, protects against online attacks, and
provides real-time statistics," said Marco Houwen, CEO and co-founder of
LuxCloud. "We are thrilled to be adding CloudFlare to our marketplace so
that our partners can offer enhanced performance and increased security
to their customers."</p>
<p>"The new Parallels Plesk Panel plugin is a great addition that allows
for quick and easy deployment of CloudFlare on our shared web hosting,
virtual and dedicated servers," said Gerardo Altman, CEO of Velocity
Host. "CloudFlare allows us to get more out of every server and network
connection in our cloud."</p>
